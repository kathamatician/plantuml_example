# Learning Through Exercises

## Introduction
Learning by doing is one of the most effective methods to acquire new knowledge and skills. Rather than passively consuming information, actively engaging in problem-solving fosters deeper understanding and long-term retention. By working through structured exercises, students can grasp complex concepts in a more intuitive and applicable way. This approach is particularly beneficial in technical fields like programming, mathematics, and engineering.

## Tasks
1. **Write a Summary**: Summarize the concept of "learning by doing" in 3-5 sentences.
2. **Example Identification**: List three examples from your own experience where learning through exercises helped you understand a topic better.
3. **Create an Exercise**: Design a simple exercise for a topic of your choice that someone else could use to practice.
4. **Follow an Exercise**: Find an online tutorial that includes exercises and complete at least two of them.
5. **Modify an Existing Exercise**: Take a basic problem from a textbook or online course and modify it to make it slightly more challenging.
6. **Pair Learning**: Explain a concept to a partner and guide them through an exercise without giving direct answers.
7. **Review Mistakes**: Look at an exercise you've previously completed incorrectly. Identify why the mistake happened and how to prevent it in the future.
8. **Time Challenge**: Set a timer for 10 minutes and try to solve as many simple exercises as possible on a given topic.
9. **Self-Assessment**: Create a checklist to evaluate your own performance in completing exercises effectively.
10. **Reflect on Progress**: Write a short paragraph on how this structured approach to exercises has influenced your learning.
